# Overview

Hello! My name is Aaron, and I'm a seventh-grader at the Mount Waverly Secondary College. One of my passions is learning about coding, and I truly enjoy creating websites, just like this one!

## About me

- I have the pleasure of knowing how to create websites like these using HTML and CSS. On weekends, I love spending time with my father as we learn and practice programming together. Through these valuable lessons, I've acquired skills in using Python to create exciting games like Snake, Pong, and Blackjack, as well as crafting websites like this one.

- I take pride in not only being skilled at mathematics but also genuinely enjoying it. The fascinating aspect of math that captures my interest is that, while there is typically just one correct answer, there are countless paths one can take to arrive at that solution..

If you are a programmer/technical person, you want to see how my website build, you can check below:
