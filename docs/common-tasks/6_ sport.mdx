# Sport 

## Sports 

I have played a variety of sports from basketball, tennis, swimming, badminton but my favourite now would be badmington. I started having lessons before lockdown but after that, I never got a chance to improve my badmington skills. Nevertheless, I still find that badminton is my favorited sport because of ut's fast-paced nature and how exciting I find it.
