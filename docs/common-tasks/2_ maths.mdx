# Maths

## MATHS


I believe that maths is essential in everyday life as it allows us to understand the world around us in further depth. Everywhere in the world, there is math to be found. From calculating the area or the amount of time until the next bus, math is without a doubt the most practical subject in real life.

When I imagine of a elegant mathematical idea, I imagine an idea that seems complex to start, but when applied with the necessary steps, it becomes so simple that everybody can understand.

## An elegant maths question

I recently discovered an interesting problem. What does 111,111,111^2 equal?
This problem may seen puzzeling and problematic at first, but it really is a simple question.
You can break this problem down by first starting with this. 
11 x 11=121, 111 x 111=12321, 1111 x 1111=1234321
Do you see a pattern?
This pattern shows that each digit that is made up of 1 squared will have up to that of the amount of 1's as the middle number with the the digits next to the number descending. However, This formula doesn't work when applying 10 digits.
Can you now figure out what 111,111,111^2 is equal?

## What I would like to achieve in mathematics 

What are my goals for my mathematical journey? I would like to able to further my understanding of mathematics and understand many easier ways to solve complex mathematical problems like the 111,111,111^2 problem.
