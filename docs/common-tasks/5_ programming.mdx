# Programming

## Why I love programming

The thing I love most about programming are the many problems I am faced with while programming. While they may take time to fix, they provide a sense of accomplishment when I solve them. 

I have experimented with using HTML and CSS, a bit of LUA and some basic python. On python I have made many iconic games such as snake, blackjack and many more. I have used my knowledge of HTML AND CSS to make the front-end of websites. I greatly enjoy programming and aspire to become a programmer when I grow up.
