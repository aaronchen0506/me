# Music

## Piano

As my fingers fly across the piano, creating a beautiful melody expressing my emotions. It's a calming kind of hobby where I can feel at ease as I get lost in the melody. 
I'm currently preparing for my grade 6 piano exam(piano for repertoire). "There are eighty-eight keys on a piano and within that, an entire universe.‚Äù - James Rhodes.

## Flute

This year, I began learning a second instrument, the flute. It's a beatiful instrument that can play many mesmerising notes. While my tuning is around 0-15 off, I strive to fix that as I practise flute. After all, who's going to listen to you play when your notes sound unusual?

## Clarinet 

Just a few weeks ago, I started learning another instrument. It was compulsary to learn another instrument, so I picked the clarinet. It's like a flute in a way, but it's facing down not sidewyas. I find this instrument to be very intriguing as I have never come across this.
